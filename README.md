# Uber Application

This Java application is a clone of the popular ride-sharing service Uber. It replicates core functionalities of Uber, allowing users to request rides, drivers to accept requests, and facilitates the entire ride process.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in securely.
- **Ride Request**: Users can request rides by specifying their pickup and drop-off locations.
- **Driver Assignment**: Drivers receive ride requests and can choose to accept or reject them.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Users can track the location of their assigned driver in real-time.
- **Wallet Integration**: Wallet feature for payment.

## Technology Used

- **Java (JDK â€“ 20)**: Core programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **Hibernate**: ORM tool for database interaction.
- **Lombok**: Library that reduces boilerplate code by automatically generating common methods like getters, setters, and constructors during compile time through annotations.
- **Jackson Data Format XML**: Library for parsing and generating XML data formats, providing seamless integration with XML-based applications.
- **Tomcat**: Servlet container that implements the Java Servlet and Java Server Pages specifications, providing a platform for deploying and running Java web applications.
- **Spring Boot Security**: Module that provides authentication and authorization support for Spring Boot applications, enabling secure access control and user management.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, often used for stateless authentication and authorization in web applications.
- **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: Specification that provides a framework for managing relational data in Java applications through object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **Google Distance API**: Service that provides travel distance and time estimates based on various transportation modes between multiple origins and destinations.

## Tools

- **Postman**: API client tool used for testing and debugging HTTP APIs by sending requests and inspecting responses.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool that manages dependencies, compiles code, and facilitates project management using XML configuration files.

## Design Patterns

- **Builder Design Pattern**: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing the creation of different object configurations through a builder class.
- **Factory Design Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Singleton Design Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Behavioral design pattern where a request is passed through a chain of handlers, each capable of processing or passing it to the next handler in the chain.

## Login Instructions
